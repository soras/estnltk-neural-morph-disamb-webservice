This folder should contain weights and data for a trained neural model.
You can get the model files from here: [https://entu.keeleressursid.ee/api2/file-24912](https://entu.keeleressursid.ee/api2/file-24912). Just unpack the zip file in a way that the content of the `output` directory in zip ends up inside the sub directory `output` in this directory.
